# Godot.BindingsGeneration

Library to generate .NET bindings from a [`extension_api.json`](../../gdextension/extension_api.json) API dump and a [`gdextension_interface.h`](../../gdextension/gdextension_interface.h) header file.

Both files are included in this repository and should be regularly updated but can also be retrieved from a Godot engine build. See the [gdextension](../../gdextension) directory for more details.

The generator uses [Godot.BindingsGeneration.ApiDump](../Godot.BindingsGeneration.ApiDump) to deserialize the API dump and [ClangSharp](https://github.com/dotnet/clangsharp) to generate the GDExtension interface bindings from the header file.

To generate bindings using MSBuild, use the [Godot.BindingsGeneration.Tasks](../Godot.BindingsGeneration.Tasks) package.
